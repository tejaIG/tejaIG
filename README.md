Teja. That's the name. <img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30">

Engineer. Lone Wolf. Full-Time Grinder.

Another engineer on the grind from Hyderabad, locked in on building Kruthrima Sadharana Medhassu (AGI). Not the cringe kind, the based kind.

Fueled by sheer willpower and Hyderabadi biryani. My brain has more forks than a GitHub repo, but the code still ships. It's called the sigma mindset. JavaScript? It exists. We don't talk about it.

ðŸš€ The Grindset

ðŸŒ± Â  Learning? Bro, I'm downloading skills directly into the cerebellum. Still can't center a div though.

ðŸ‘¯ Â  Only collaborating on based OSS for Bharat. No cringe projects. Your idea better be 10x.

ðŸ¤” Â  Scheming the next big thing. If your PR includes !important, it's an automatic L.

ðŸ’¬ Â  Talk to me about Go, Python, or why Hyderabadi Biryani mogs every other dish. No small talk.

ðŸ“« Â  Reach me if you must: teja@furlove.in. My DMs are open for alpha-level discussions only.

âš¡ Â  Fun fact: I can Rickroll you via an API. Don't test me.
