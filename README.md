Hi there, I'm Teja! <img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30">

Engineer, Builder, and part-time stand-up comedian (in my head).

I'm a code-wrangling, data-juggling engineer from Hyderabad, India, on a cosmic quest to build Kruthrima Sadharana Medhassu (AGI)... but the friendly, chai-loving version that won't go all Skynet on us. Probably.

Fueled by Hyderabadi biryani and a brain with way too many browser tabs open (some call it ADHD, I call it a 'feature, not a bug'), I build everything from robust backends to quirky little web apps. I also have a famously complicated love-hate relationship with JavaScript.

ðŸš€ What I'm Up To

ðŸ”­ Â  Iâ€™m currently working on Annadata.ai, an open-source project to help Indian farmers with data-driven insights.

ðŸŒ± Â  Iâ€™m currently learning all things data-driven... and how to finally center a div on the first try.

ðŸ‘¯ Â  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Open Source Software tailored to solve Indian problems. Got a cool idea? Hit me up!

ðŸ¤” Â  Iâ€™m looking for help with my next big project idea. Preferably one that doesn't involve !important.

ðŸ’¬ Â  Ask me about OSS, Python, Go, or why Hyderabadi Biryani is the one true king of all dishes.

ðŸ“« Â  How to reach me: teja@furlove.in or slide into my DMs.

âš¡ Â  Fun fact: I built a Rickroll-as-a-Service API. You've been warned.
