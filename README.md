Hi, I'm Teja 👋

I'm an engineer based in Hyderabad, India. I'm passionate about building new things and am currently focused on the challenges and possibilities of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), or Kruthrima Sadharana Medhassu.

I'm a dedicated developer, fueled by a lot of curiosity (and Hyderabadi biryani!). I enjoy tackling complex problems, shipping code, and always learning. My preferred languages are Go and Python.

What I'm Working On

    🌱 I'm always learning and applying new skills. (Though I'll admit, centering a div can still be a challenge!)

    👯 I'm interested in collaborating on meaningful open-source projects, especially those that benefit India (Bharat).

    🤔 I'm currently exploring new ideas for my next project and believe strongly in writing clean, high-quality code.

Let's Connect

    💬 I'm always happy to discuss Go, Python, new technologies, or the finer points of Hyderabadi biryani.

    📫 You can reach me at: teja@furlove.in

    ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy building fun, quirky things with APIs.
